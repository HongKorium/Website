                    Dear viewer, fan, or friend.<br><br>
                    This is my message to you. As I started streaming and content creating, I started out not knowing what to do, but when it’s just your creativity to engage the audience, I quickly took it in and made it my dream career. I am still building this career and I think I can do it even though many have already put me down saying it is not for you. I started streaming during the start of the covid era and I have not stopped since, but I stream almost every single day but at a very inconsistent rate, sometimes starting at 5 A.M. or at 1 P.M. as I do not have a fixed schedule. Content creation and streaming is one of the hardest careers of life, if you want to help me on this path, it would be my dream.<br><br>
                    But there is a side effect to this for me, I have social phobia (an anxiety disorder that causes people to experience in-tense and persistent fear and anxiety in social or performance situations) as from a very young age or even when I started school from kindergarten, I was picked on, bullied, harassed, and hurt mentally. A teacher I used to have had a teaching style of punishing students by making them write a repeated sentence of phrase around a hundred times, this was mental torture to me as I had to write one almost every two weeks. Eventually, I broke down, starting breaking many objects at home and I was soon transferred to a different school by my parents. The teacher was shortly removed from staff afterwards. Another problem is I have a stutter in my speech and talk fast, like xQc, no joke. As people who I thought were my friends harassed me almost every single day. All the bullying, harassing all contribute to my breakdown. Later I was put into therapy by my parents, but that didn’t help at all since my parents didn't even listen to the therapist other than transferring schools at that moment of time. But at my new school where I was transferred to, I was also treated like crap by others. I think it’s just me but everyone treats me like crap. I did have suicidal thoughts after that, still am almost every single month.<br><br>
                    Enough of that, let’s talk about the positive side, many people have actually supported me which I greatly appreciate. Streaming, content creating, and making lots of friends through the internet through networking is great. From 0 to around 200 Twitch followers in less than a year from when I actually started streaming every single day, is not a bad start. I really appreciate every single one of my followers. If I don’t remember you, I am very sorry, but just a little reminder would help me out. I do have short term memory loss (the inability to retain recent information) from people that interact with me for a brief moment of time. Just like the, someone gives you their name, you forget it scenario, though it is every single day and every single time for me. Losing track here, from YouTube to Twitch. I greatly appreciate every single one of my subscribers, followers, and Twitch subs.<br><br>
                    I love every single one of my supporters with a passion. Thank you for reading my message to you, viewer, fan, or friend. Have a great rest of your day!
