                    Dear viewer, fan, or friend,<br><br>
                    This is my message to you. So you may know me as many names, which some of you know, some of you don't. I play video games having fun and while streaming it. From a young age, I have been bullied, harrassed. I stream to communicate with people through the internet as a side hustle.
